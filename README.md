# MIUI Camera For Redmi 10C with AOSP

MIUI camera for **Redmi 10C** adapted for **AOSP**-based firmware

This module only adds the necessary libraries to `system/lib64`, permissions to `system/etc` and installs the camera to `system/priv-app/MiuiCamera`

## 📥 Installation

Download [`miui-camera-fog.zip`](https://github.com/okineadev/miui-camera-fog/releases/latest/miui-camera-fog.zip) and install it in Magisk

After that you need to run `setenforce 0` command in Termux with `su` to make the camera start, I might fix this in the next update.
